## Next.js App Router Course - Starter


### Learn Next.js
In Next.js App Router interactive course, I have learned the main features of Next.js by building a full-stack web application.

It's a simplified version of a financial dashboard that has:

A public home page.
A login page.
Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which I'll set up in a later chapter.

With this course I have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.
